# Purpose

The purpose of this is to create materials for former and possibly future
web development students.  This is currently completely seperate from GA and
doest not fit GA standards for course materials.  This repo __will not__ meet
GA standards at any point, nor will any of the additional materials that follow.

If this is ever to be intergrated, this version will remain but not be
maintained.  Why? It allows me more freedom to go off in strange directions and
use colloquial, fun and language that would not otherwise have a place in
standard course materials.

Again why?

**FOR ALL THE LULZ**
